# the-bakery-task

This is the task we are looking to complete:

A bakery in France struggles to produce the right amount of products each day. They thought that by collecting sales data they could reduce waste whilst keeping customers happy by always providing fresh products. Anecdotally, they know that weather affects the sales, and so they obtained daily weather statistics as well. However, they need help in building an accurate forecasting model which can take those data into account and lower the food waste and monetary loss.

 

Please see attached datasets labelled ‘bakery_sales.csv’ and ‘weather_2021.01.01-2022.10.31.csv’.

These are available in the data folder, the readme.md in the data folder describes the structure.

 

Please deliver a report with a maximum of 500 words and 3 figures on how you have deciphered the data and provide the bakery with appropriate insight to the problem. Report also any issues or limitation in the data and provide the code you used to perform the analysis and modelling.
